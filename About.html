                An academic prize or award is something you receive as recognition for your achievements or successes as a student.
                
                For example, you might receive an award or prize that demonstrates that you were toward the top of your class, or that you were tapped as a promising student.
                
                Also consider awards and prizes that you received for entering contests, such as essay writing contests or even a science fair.
                
                Winning an academic award can significantly boost your profile and open up further opportunities for advancement.

               <P>Taking part in a study abroad program shows a willingness to step out of one’s comfort zone and an ability to adapt to new environments.
                
                This experience can also indicate language skills and a global perspective, both of which are valuable in many professional settings.
                
                 In addition, study abroad programs often involve navigating complex logistics, which can demonstrate problem-solving and organizational skills, which are all desirable for future employers.

                        Even if you haven’t been to university, you may be able to recall a time you received a certification, such as when you participated in a continuing education certification for your workplace.

                    Make sure it’s a certification that has some academic merit, such as requiring you to sit an exam. Even better, if you can present one that comes with an officially recognized

                     ‘seal’ such as a red seal for a trade, you could frame this as academic, especially if you had to go to a continuing education institution and learn theory to gain this certification.

                The University of Southern California was incorporated by the Methodist Episcopal church in 1880; it opened the same year. After his arrival in 1917, philosopher Ralph Tyler Flewelling established USC as a bastion of personalism. In the 1920s the university created one of the country’s first schools of international relations and of public administration, as well as a pioneer program in cinematography. The first doctoral degree was awarded in 1923. The university officially became nonsectarian in 1926. Architect Konrad Wachsmann joined the faculty in 1963 and initiated a doctoral program in building science.

Norman Schwarzkopf, composer Charles Wakefield Cadman, architect Frank Gehry, actor John Wayne, director José Quintero, and filmmaker George Lucas.
