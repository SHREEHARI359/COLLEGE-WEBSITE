            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>A college is an academic institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a degree-awarding educational institution. So, college
             is the place where one can get higher education for achieving his or her career goal. College is indeed necessary for each and every one. Thus for a successful career, the student needs knowledge, confidence, academic and technical skills, career opportunities and social skills</H3><br>

             <P>
                It is important to understand how College is different from the last school you attended and how well your own past educational experiences have prepared you for what you will find in college.

College is a unique experience for all students â€” whether you just graduated from high school or are returning to education after years of working or studying in Canada for the first time. You are transitioning from one form of education to another.
